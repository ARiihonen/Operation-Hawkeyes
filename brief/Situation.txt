Polzin, codename Jokeri, was observed in the vicinity of <marker name = 'marker_pustoshka'>Pustoshka</marker> just two days ago. Further recon has verified that he is using the towns of <marker name = 'marker_pustoshka'>Pustoshka</marker>, <marker name = 'marker_pogorevka'>Pogorevka</marker>, and <marker name = 'marker_rogovo'>Rogovo</marker> as a staging ground for IED attacks on UN convoys on <marker name = 'marker_msr'>MSR Tuonela</marker>.
